# State-Space-Models
Application of Bayesian State Space Models in macroeconometrics

Bayesian inference using state space models and kalman filtering. This code predicts time series (e.g. crude oil price development and demeaned log returns), showing not only posterior distribution of fitted values but also posterior distribution of latent trend component, standard deviation of shocks to the trend component and standard deviation of shocks to the transitory component.
